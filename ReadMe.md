# Positive News of the day

As our Honorable President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam had once said that news papers

_"Why canâ€™t you carry positive news on page 1? The front pages of all newspapers I see are crammed with news of scandals, crime and death. It is better to give good news to help people begin their day with hope"_

_"A man or a woman should smile in the morning. Don't make
him or her unhappy."_
